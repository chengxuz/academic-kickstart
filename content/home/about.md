# Biography

I am an ICoN Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT, primarily working with [Ev Fedorenko](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/ev-fedorenko/) and [Jacob Andreas](https://www.mit.edu/~jda/).
Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Stanford, advised by [Daniel Yamins](http://web.stanford.edu/~yamins/).
I am interested in both understanding brains and developing more effective AI models.
